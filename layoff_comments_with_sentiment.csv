What was an issue? I work for the same company and the same union on other branch. It been tremendously slow down for a while. Staff cutting is going on right now. And jobs arent coming in instead going out to other non union facility.,-0.12748015873015872,negative
They actually laid off 200 employees.,0.0,neutral
This doesn't necessarily imply that the people being laid off will not have a job. Often the next company who is awarded the same government contract will hire the same staff. There is a shortage of certified behavioral health counselors so they will most likely be hired again.  In these situations the government contractor  is really just a staffing agency that handles only payroll and HR services. If we dive into employee reviews on glass door and indeed we can see that many employees were unsatisfied with the lack of management form this company..,0.13333333333333333,positive

"Well, let me share a little story.  Probably not that ordinary but instructive nonetheless.   So a friend/acquaintance of mine, with no technical background gets a job offer - and I’m not sure how he got clued into it, but he’s given a large salary at this so-called ‘startup’ He’s a white guy, and he and his wife are telling me what a good opportunity this is to get in on the ground floor, this is going places, etc.  They were trying to convince and recruit me, telling me and my wife that I should quit my job and come along with him.   The owner/founder is from India, and pretty much all the staff (a number of people) were from India. Well it turns out that - at least what I was told in the end, was that in America, if you plunk down enough money, you can  ‘found a company’ and staff it with whomever you want.   In this case it was staffed by a large group of Indian expats looking to get their green cards.   My friend got lured in, but the. More I heard about this ‘startup’ the less I was liking it.  For example l, I mentioned what was on their whiteboard?  And my friend said he asked the founder, who, alarmed by this, said ‘Yes, yes! We need a whiteboard!’ And went out and bought one.   Well about two months later, the founder/owner gets busted.  I think all his staff got arrested too.   It was completely bogus, and somehow the authorities unearthed what they were up to.  It was completely a pay to play operation, and demonstrates the length these knuckleheads will go to come to America and to get a green card!  I remember how ridiculous it all sounded as my friend was relating all this to me. I’m just glad it came to someone’s attention to put a stop to this nonsense.   Who knows, maybe there are more of these bogus operations ‘founded’ here for the purpose of getting green cards for their foreign born staff.   From everything I’m hearing, right now it’s a free for all and kind of like the freakin Wild West, and all bets are off.   Maybe some OPs have heard or observed similar stories?",0.07174933862433863,neutral

"Kaiser had been laying off their worker since about 2019. In 2020, they laid off 100’s of employees in accounting and finance and outsourced those jobs to India.

It sounds like they are covering themself for wrongful termination but again; being able to cite company performance for layoff is easier in Texas than other states.    I’ll be honest and say I don’t think you can sue them. What would your case be? It sounds like they may have built an internal case.
